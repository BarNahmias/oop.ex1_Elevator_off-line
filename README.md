## Off-line --- On-line Algorithms for the Elevator:
Motivation: In most scheduling problems, if the problem were off-line, i.e. we know the arrival time of a request, then we can find the optimal schedule. But in reality this is not the case and we need to use some heuristics or strategies or on-line algorithms for scheduling.  The question is which strategy is better.[^1]

## my Off-line Algorithm  -  Optimal response for requests:  
1. Set a division parameter according to time units 
- partition = (time of last call - time of first call) / amount of all the calls
-Sort the readings according to division parameter
2. Dividing the status of requests into two groups
- group A : up calls
- group B : down calls
3. Matching a request to an elevator
4. Order to the elevator 
- According to the request
5. Send
6. Repit

## unitest 
We will compare the results of off line to an online algorithm, due to the differences we made between the algorithms we would expect off line algorithm to give a more optimal result compared to the online algorithm
